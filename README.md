# Test snap

This snap is used by me to test Snapcraft commands that users have reported as faulty in Snapcraft's forums or via Launchpad.

Feel free to reuse it in case you want to test a snap too. 

This snap is still under devel confinement and devel grade. You first need to make the changes and then use it to publish and/or
build locally.

## How to use

If you get lost at how to set-up apps and parts, this particular app uses the snap name to be ran in the terminal (`gsilva-test-snap`).
